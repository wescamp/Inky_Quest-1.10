Therefore, when the dwarves discovered Ravyan's crumbled remains, they assumed that the lich-lord was slain by some unknown dwarvish hero who was later slain by either trolls or sea monsters. The troll attributed the defeat of the undead to one of their kind, but no one ever believes trolls..."

The expedition found Daedry's fortress in ruins, with no enemy in sight. Then they met dwarves bragging about how they had defeated an ancient lich. The humans quickly made the connection and Sir Daedry became known as hero killed by an evil lich who was then slain by brave dwarves."
